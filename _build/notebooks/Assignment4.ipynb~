On each day, researchers also recorded the daily high temperature `T`, and the level of some atmospheric pollutants `P`.\n",

    "$\\text{Var}(Y) = E(Y)$. In words,  this says that the variance of the outcome is equal to the expected value of the outcome. Using a two-stage procedure, fit a weighted least squares regression to `Y` as a function of `T` and `P` with weights being inversely proportional to the fitted values of the initial model in 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Looking at the usual diagnostics plots of this model (which takes the weights into account), does the constant variance assumption seem more reasonable? (The change may not be astonishing -- the point of the problem is to try using weighted least squares.)\n",

A simple way to do this is along the lines of `full.lm = lm(lpsa.noisy ~ ., data=prostate)` (substituting your `data.frame` for `prostate` below. Then, you can put `list(upper=full.lm)` as the `scope` argument to `step` where `lpsa.noisy = lpsa + rnorm(length(lpsa), sd=?)` and an appropriate choice of `sd`.\n",
