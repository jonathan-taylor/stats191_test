    "In a recent, exciting, but also controversial Science article, [Tomasetti and Vogelstein](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6217/78.full) attempt to explain why cancer incidence varies drastically across tissues (e.g. why one is much more likely to develop lung cancer rather than pelvic bone cancer). The authors show that a higher average lifetime risk for a cancer in a given tissue correlates with the rate of replication of stem cells in that tissue. The main inferential tool for their statistical analysis was a simple linear regression, which we will replicate here. \n",
